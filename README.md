GOTP aims to be the CLI version of Google Authenticator that we use daily to secure our accounts.
As a Vim lover, I enjoy having (most of) my work done without leaving keyboard.


## Why using it
**More efficient**
- In order to get an OTP from your phone when working on computer, we need:
    - Grab a phone
    - Unlock it
    - Find google authenticator app
    - Read the OTP
    - Type it on computer
- Although these action seems can be done less than 30 seconds, repeating it while working on a computer (like what I did) is a pain
- As a developer, it would be better if I can just get my OTP without leaving a computer (even keyboard)
- You can feel the efficiency especially when you need to get different OTPs from different issuers frequently
- Your OTP can be available in 3 seconds by utilizing this application (OTP is copied to clipboard immediately after generated)

**Easy to Backup**
- All your data are stored in single database file (sqlite file), you just need to keep the file in somewhere secure (cloud, hard disk, ...)
	- When you lost your phone, your secret is still available on cloud
	- The [secret](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format#secret) of your OTP is encryped in database
	- Even you lost the file, your OTP still won't be accessible by others
- Portable backup file means you can make it avialble in any computers you want (working computer, home computer, need to switch to another computer, ...)

*Caveat:\
Some people might think it goes against the purpose of OTP to store OTP on the same device with the application youâ€™re using.\
Use it if it brings more advantages to you while this doesn't bother you.*

## Prerequisite
`go version ^1.14`

## Installation
```
# Clone source code
$ git clone git@github.com:ganboonhong/gotp.git

# Change to package directory
$ cd gotp

# Get package dependencies
$ go get ./...

# Compile and install package
$ go install

# Setup database
$ gotp app init
```

## Usage


| Create Account    | Delete Account    | Generate OTP 	   |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `gotp otp create` | `gotp otp delete` | `gotp [otp] gen` |

Since generate OTP command is likely to be used frequently, there is a shorthand `gotp gen` for `gotp otp gen`.
